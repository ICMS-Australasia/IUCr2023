A packed agenda of food, wine, sports and arts is your introduction to the best of Melbourne – from its creative, exciting city centre, to its buzzing neighbourhood hubs. It's the gateway to Victoria's world-class wineries, natural springs, peninsulas, spectacular coastline and alpine villages, making it the ideal destination for easy access to pre and post Conference touring.

Visitors will find Melbourne an exciting city to explore. Modern architecture and design are juxtaposed with heritage buildings reflecting Australia’s cultural history. But beneath the city’s impressive façade, lies the true heart and soul of the city; laneways which snake the city grid to reveal cafes and bars, fashion houses, boutiques, innovative cuisine, galleries, theatres and museums.

Melbourne has a lively passion for social eating and drinking, which is reflected in the thousands of restaurants serving up gastronomic experiences from around the world. Everywhere you will uncover a vast array of fashionable cafes, where you can enjoy Melbourne's existential coffee and cafe culture to the fullest.
