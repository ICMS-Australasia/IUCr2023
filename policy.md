## Gender equity and diversity

The IUCr is committed to achieving gender equity and diversity (that mirrors our crystallography community) in all its endeavours and activities. A key aspect of the IUCr mission is to ensure our community fosters inclusion, ensures mutual respect, and embraces diversity. To help achieve its diversity goals, the IUCr has developed a code of conduct which applies to all its endorsed or funded activities.
