## Visa options for Conferences, Congresses, Trade Fairs, Seminars or Expos

All visitors to Australia must have a valid visa to travel to and enter Australia (other than New Zealand passport holders who will normally be granted a Special Category visa on arrival, provided they meet health and character requirements; and permanent residents of Norfolk Island who may be granted a Permanent Resident of Norfolk Island visa on arrival).

If you are planning to visit Australia for a business event such as a conference, trade fair, seminar or expo, there may be different visa options available to you. The appropriate visa will depend, amongst other things, on your purpose for visiting Australia.
