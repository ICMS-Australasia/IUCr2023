                        <p>It has certainly been an exciting and busy period in the lead-up to the end of the year.  From confirming new sponsors Malvern Panalytical (Ruby level) and Excillum at (Topaz);  to the re-opening of the Call for Abstracts until 21 February 2023. The IUCr 2023 Committee warmly invites you to submit an abstract to one of the many specific microsymposiums running at the Conference. There are over 120 opportunities for you to consider. We are sure you will find the <a href = "https://iucr2023.org/microsymposiums/" target = "_blank">program’s length</a> and breadth quite tempting.</p>
                        <p>We have been to the regional town of Bendigo for the SCANZ (Society of Crystallographers in Australia and New Zealand) Crystallography Conference called Crystal 34, where we celebrated structural science and reunited face-to-face after a three-year hiatus. Awards were given to both established and early career researchers to recognise their outstanding achievements. Appropriately, one award was made possible from the 1987 Fund Lecture created by the IUCr Congress in the city of Perth, Australia, of that year. The 1987 lecture this year was given by Professor Elspeth Garman from the University of Oxford, UK.</p>
                       <p>In recognition of our Retired Members’ long-term dedication and outstanding contributions to our community, we have decided that a reduced <a href = "https://iucr2023.org/registration/" target = "_blank">registration fee</a> is warranted and trust that this <i>gift voucher</i> will pave the way for your continued involvement in the IUCr Congress. The Retiree rate is only available for the Early Bird period, which ends 31 March 2023.</p>
                        <p>We thank all of you who have engaged with IUCr 2023 over the past year. On behalf of the Organising Committee, we wish everyone a safe and happy holiday season and look forward to welcoming you to Melbourne for what is shaping up to be an incredibly exciting crystallography event in August 2023.</p>
                       <p>From all of us here in Australasia and especially the IUCr 2023 Local Organising Team, we send you our warmest wishes.</p>
                       <p>Michael</p>

                        <p>In the final local meeting before IUCr 2023, the Society of Crystallographers in Australia and New Zealand (SCANZ) met in Bendigo, a regional city in the heart of the Victorian goldfields 2 hours north of Melbourne, for Crystal 34 on December 6-9. With around 130 attendees (55:45 male:female), a vibrant and diverse program of invited speakers (53:47 m:f) and speakers selected from abstracts (56:44 m:f) ensured a very busy and rewarding meeting for all. </p>
                        <p>Highlights included the 1987 Fund Lecture by Elspeth Garman (Oxford) and the awarding of the 2022 Sandy Mathieson Medal to Stephanie Gras (La Trobe) and the 2023 Lawrence Bragg Medal to Richard Welberry (ANU).</p>
                        <p>Other highlights included the always popular Rising Stars session, updates from the national crystallography facilities and on the upcoming IUCr 2023 meeting (including the Bragg Your Pattern activities), and a peek into the long history of the ‘Bush Crystallographers’ (known today as SCANZ). </p>
                        <p>Bendigo provided another opportunity for us to refuel and chat over a brew about IUCr 2023.</p>
                        <p>In the New Year, in early February, we will be seeing the protein science community from around Australia assemble at the <a href = "https://www.lorneproteins.org/" target = "_blank">8th Lorne Conference on Protein Structure and Function</a>, one of the longest-running protein science conferences in the world.  Travelling to Lorne via the Great Ocean Road is one of the most picturesque road journeys in Australia.  If you have time, make sure you stop by the 12 Apostles for an iconic photo opportunity.
