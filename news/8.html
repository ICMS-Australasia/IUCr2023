                        <p>Speaking of approaching the “finishing post”, Australians pause on the first Tuesday in November each year to watch the horse “race that stops a nation”. The Melbourne Cup was first held in 1861. And like our IUCr Congress, representatives from around the world compete for the honour of winning the world-famous race. With the calibre of talent and creativity that I have witnessed this month with the Winner of the Bragg Your Pattern competition being announced, the future of our science is in safe hands. From the 20 Finalists, we have narrowed it down to the final ten, which was not an easy task for the Braggy team.</p>
                        <p>The Local Organising Committee would like to extend our deepest gratitude to the organisers of the 17th International Conference of the Asian Crystallographic Association recently held in Jeju, Korea. The Chair and Deputy Chair of the Conference, Professor Kyeong Kyu Kim and Professor Sangho Lee, were invaluable support to our team pre-event. We trust we can return your kindness and helpfulness at IUCr 2023 next year.</p>
                        <p>Our final destination for 2022 is a little closer to home – in a little town called Bendigo. In 1851 the discovery of gold transformed what was a sheep station into one of Australia’s largest boomtowns and encouraged an influx of migrants from around the world, particularly from Europe and China. One of the legacies of the gold boom is the many ornate buildings that can still be seen today. Located approximately two hours north of Melbourne, this regional town, now famous for its pottery and ceramics, is the location for the 34th Biennial Conference of the Society of Crystallographers in Australia and New Zealand <a href = "https://www.crystal34.org/" target = "_blank">CRYSTAL 34.</a>  Most of the team, including myself, will be there, so please stop by for a brew or two.</p>
                        <p>Kind regards,</p>
                        <p><strong>Michael Parker</strong><br>Chair, IUCr 2023</p>

                        <h3>New Zealand’s West Coast, from Rocks to Glaciers</h3>
                        <img src = "img/pancakeRocksCaption.png" width = "560px">
                        <p>IUCr 2023 is being hosted by SCANZ, short for the Society of Crystallographers in Australia and New Zealand – so why not ‘hop across the ditch’ (the Tasman Sea) to visit our antipodean neighbours in Aotearoa/New Zealand after or before the Melbourne Congress?  New Zealand has many highlights for the discerning crystallographer and perhaps the land of the long white cloud is most famous for its spectacular scenery.  Nowhere is this more on show than on the West coast of the South Island.  Starting at the Punakaiki pancake rocks, you walk along and explore the striking and unusual landforms carved out from the sea.  All along the west coast of South Island has been the source of much pounamu, or greenstone, used by New Zealand’s original inhabitants, the Maori people.  Pounamu is a general term and individual greenstone can be a number of different minerals; you can explore this more at New Zealand’s national museum in Wellington (another must-see) Te Papa.  Further South from the Punakaiki rocks lay the Fox and Franz-Joeph glaciers, two of the most accessible glaciers in the world, given that they both flow nearly to sea level.  Though that is rapidly changing, you can still see how these magnificent bodies of ice have been part of a system that carved the dramatic Southern alps.</p>
                        <p>Well-known pioneer of crystallography, Lindo Patterson, of Patterson function fame, was born in Nelson, New Zealand, in 1902. His family moved to Canada when he was 18 months old and later to London when he was 14. Equally famous is Maurice Wilkins, who shared the 1962 Nobel Prize with Watson and Crick “for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material”. He was born in the small town of Pongaroa, New Zealand, in 1916 and moved with his family to England when he was seven.</p>
