                            <p>The IUCr 2023 countdown begins. A major milestone for the IUCr 2023 Congress – one year to the start of the 26th Congress and General Assembly of the International Union of Crystallography.  Our Call for Abstracts and Bursary applications are all open today allowing three months (until 21 November) to submit. Registration is also now open, early bird savings are on offer until 15 February 2023.</p>
                            <p>It was our privilege to attend ACA 2022 - American Crystallographic Association 72nd Annual Meeting in Portland, Oregon. This first ACA face-to-face meeting since the pandemic. The excitement and appetite for the IUCr Congress in Australia was palpable.  We met over 500 crystallography friends, many of whom were first-time attendees and who were grateful for the opportunity to reunite.</p>
                            <p>Later this month the team will be in Versailles at the 33rd European Crystallographic Meeting between 23- 27 of August 2022. Our LOC member Helen Maynard Casey will be presenting and there will be a few of the Melbournians in attendance to cheer her on. Stop by our stand at #29 for your touch of Australia.</p>
                            <p>Kind regards,</p>

                            <p>Thank you to the ACA (American Crystallography Association) for hosting us in Portland. What a fantastic city and what a terrific event.</p>
                            <p>Our attendance not only raised awareness of the Congress, as many ACA were first time attendees, but it solidified our aim that IUCr 2023 in Melbourne aims to be a predominantly in-person event. Our conversations with delegates centred on the opportunities for potential delegates to attend both the business reason for travel and new life experiences. Like ACA – IUCr is a family friendly meeting.  We intend to provide a safe environment for families to meet and fun zone for children to participate. </p>
                            <p>Our clip-on Koalas proved to be one of the most popular give-aways, as did our gigantic Koala photo backdrop! In total, we dispersed 700+ koalas – clearly we had more than one visit per delegate! Our bespoke sustainable Melbourne bamboo coffee cups were a very popular, as waste reduction is an important delegate value.  It was encouraging to spot them in the exhibition instantly filled with hot or cold beverages.</p>
                            <p>Next week you can collect yours from our team in Versailles at the 33rd European Crystallographic Meeting between 23-27 of August 2022. See you there!</p>
