                            <p>Melbourne is a must-see destination, and the Congress is undoubtedly the main attraction! But from Melbourne, you can plan your journey to any number of scientific, technical, cultural, and recreational experiences around Australia.  </p>
                            <p>From the giant dishes at Tidbinbilla and Parkes that received man’s first steps on the moon, to the Great Barrier Reef, to 50,000 years of Aboriginal culture – Destination Australia is second to none, a once in a lifetime opportunity for IUCr 2023 delegates.  In our <a href="http://iucr2023.org/the-great-road-trip-downunder/" target="_blank">Great Down Under Road Trip</a> series this month, you will be introduced to the most remote capital city on the planet….Perth, Western Australia.  Perth’s remoteness in no way detracts from the vast richness of the resources in Western Australia, and the journey west is well worth the adventure.  Direct flights from the United Kingdom to Perth via the Dreamliner may be an option for those entering the Great Southern Land via the western gateway.</p>
                            <p>But a year is a long-time between drinks in Australia, so we have decided to bring a little bit of Melbourne to the north.  The very far north with our first stop in Oregon, USA.   The IUCr 2023 team will be hosting a booth at the American Crystallographic Association 72nd Annual Meeting in Portland, Oregon, from <b>29 July to 2 August 2022</b>.</p>
                            <p>If you haven’t already registered, what better motivation than to meet us!  We will have some fantastic giveaways, daily booth prizes, and special Australian surprises installed. We will keep you informed in the lead up to the event.  We are also planning to be in France and South Korea before the end of the year!</p>
                            <p>You can expect a fantastic experience in Melbourne, so put 22 – 29 August 2023 in your diaries, stay connected by <a href="https://icmsaust.eventsair.com/iucr-2023/expression-of-interest" target="_blank">registering your expression of interest</a> and prepare to turn crystallography upside down.</p>
                            <p>Let’s keep sharing our journey to IUCr 2023. Stay safe, stay connected!</p>

                            <img src="./img/3-3-1.jpg" width="540">
                            <p>Thirty-five years ago, the Australian crystallographic community were delighted to welcome the international community to our shores.  The event has had an enduring legacy for our society, which enabled us to establish the ‘1987 fund’, which has brought a high-profile crystallographer to our shores for each of our local Crystals meetings.   Perth was a perfect location for the Congress, despite being one of the most isolated cities in the world. Still, it has been a strength of Australian X-ray crystallography for many years, under the auspices of Ted Maslen, Allan White and many others. A homage to quasicrystals can be found in the Bayliss Building of the University of Western Australia (UWA). The floor is covered in a beautiful <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/Facilities/Bayliss-Building" target="_blank">Penrose tile floor and a 20 m DNA replica</a>.</p>

                            <p>Wider afield, the state of Western Australia is the location for some of the oldest rocks on the planet, with the Jack Hills <a href="https://www.iycr2014.org/learn/crystallography365/articles/20140220" target="_blank">zircons dated to be 4.4 billion years old</a>.  If you are willing to drive –a lot - there are numerous geo-crystallography marvels across the state – <a href="https://www.sharkbay.org/publications/fact-sheets-guides/stromatolites/" target="_blank">from the stromatolites in Shark Bay</a> and komatiites at Serpentine Bay to the karstic landforms at the <a href="https://www.westernaustralia.com/en/Attraction/Purnululu_(Bungle_Bungle)_National_Park/56b266a77b935fbe730e5b6d" target="_blank">Purnululu National Park</a>. </p>
                            <p>Perth is an ideal stop-over location for delegates joining us from Europe, with direct flights from London and Rome (starting June 2022). It’s a city of beaches, good food and a drive away from some great wine regions.</p>
