                            <p><em>‘The gift of expression is important to them as scientists; the best research is wasted when it is extremely difficult to discover what it is all about …’</em>  W.L. Bragg</p>
                            <p>Our next stop in this crystallographic tour of Australia and New Zealand is the city of Adelaide! Adelaide, which is located on the traditional lands of the Kaurna people, has a strong connection to crystallography - with one of the founders of the field, W.L. Bragg, being born here in 1890.  His father, W.H. Bragg, had moved to Adelaide in 1885 to take up a professorship at the University of Adelaide, with W.L. also beginning his studies in physics there too.</p>
                            <p>As many of us will know, W.L Bragg together with his father, WH Bragg, and Max von Laue put together the methods and equations that describes how the phenomena of diffraction can lead to an understanding of where atoms are in a structure. W.L. Bragg still is the youngest recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physics, he was 25 when he was recognised for his efforts in determining the first crystal structures from diffraction.</p>
                            <p>Adelaide is a beautiful city to visit, with a CBD surrounded by parkland and the city circled by world-famous vineyards.  As well as a trip along the river, you could take in some of the renowned museums such as the Art Gallery of South Australia, displaying expansive collections including noted Indigenous art, or the South Australian Museum which is devoted to natural history (and hosts a fantastic mineralogy department).</p>
                            <p>For those of you wanting a sporting fix, the Adelaide Oval hosts cricket and Australian rules football matches throughout the year. Wine regions around Adelaide, include the Barossa Valley, is steeped in history and German heritage, swathed in rolling landscapes of vines, orchards, pasture and bushland and full of great characters. To the West of Adelaide lies the coast and the St. Vincent Gulf, with miles of beaches, including one where a young W.L. Bragg discovered a new cuttlefish, which was named Sepia Braggii after him.</p>
                            <p>You can read much more about W.L Bragg and his father in the book <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199235209.001.0001/acprof-9780199235209" target="_blank">‘William and Lawrence Bragg, Father and Son - The Most Extraordinary Collaboration in Science’</a> written by Australian author, John Jenkin.  </p>

                            <p>Today, on International Women’s Day we have a reason to pause and reflect on progress, but also future challenges to gender equality.   Crystallography is a very unusual science in the landscape of gender equality, with strongly diverse beginnings, which are widely lauded. There have been many celebrated female role models, including two Nobel prize winners. Lonsdale, Hodgkin, Franklin, Megaw and Yonath are but a few of the distinguished women crystallographers in the field. We were very proud to honour one of our own expatriate woman crystallographers in 2021 with Eleanor Dodson being elected as a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science. Looking to the future we are working to make IUCr 2023 as inclusive as possible.</p>

                                <br>
                                <span class="sub">6-10 February 2022<br>by Daniel Eriksson and Michael Parker</span></h2>
                                <p>The famous Lorne Proteins conference, now in its 47th year, is Australia’s premier protein science conference and a favourite haunt for crystallographers from around Australia and New Zealand. Lorne is a small coastal town just over 2 hours’ drive from Melbourne. Here, the waves of the Pacific Ocean can be heard lapping the beach just outside the conference venue. Like past years, there has been a feast of structural biology presented at the conference. Invited talks from local structural biologists included Alastair Stewart (F1-ATPase), Onisha Patel (DCLK1 kinase), Stephanie Gras (T-cells and COVID), Josh Hardy (flaviviruses), Katrina Black (potassium channels), Berhard Lechtenberg (ubiquitin ligases), Andrew Ellisdon (neurofibromin), David Thal (muscarinic receptors), Rhiannon Morris (LNK kinase), Thomas Ve (SARM1) and Alisa Glukhova (adenosine receptors).</p>
                                <p>Professor Leann Tilley capped a busy program by giving this year’s Leach Lecture. Leann, The Redmond Barry Distinguished Professor of Biochemistry & Pharmacology at The University of Melbourne, gave a molecular imaging retrospective as told through the lens of decades of malaria research. The Leach medal, Australia’s highest honour in protein science, is traditionally awarded on the first day of the conference but was moved to the last day, to ensure it ended on a high while COVID-19 interferes with many of the speakers’ travels.</p>
                                <p>Simon Joshua “Syd” Leach, whose name the medal and lecture now grace, was instrumental to what would become an annual conference at the coastal town Lorne.  The town itself is located on a heritage listed 240 kilometre stretch of road called the Great Ocean Road, that hugs the rugged coastline of Victoria. The first conference, convened in 1976, attracted sixty-five participants from Victorian universities and institutes. Participation has grown since then and this year Lorne saw 217 in-person attendees and an additional 169 participating remotely. Since 1986, when Syd Leach stepped down from the Organising Committee, there has always been a keynote speech known as the Leach lecture, with the accompanying medal awarded from 2004. Past Leach lecturers include many well-known to the IUCr community including Peter Colman, Mitchell Guss, Robert Huber, Jose Varghese, Ted Baker, Brain Matthews, Eleanor Dodson, Jenny Martin and Mike Lawrence.</p>
                                <p>While the Leach Medal recognises life-time accomplishments the Anders Young Investigator Award celebrates our up-and-coming stars.  Named after Robin Anders, who chaired the Lorne Organising committee for 15 years this session moved to the first day on Sunday evening.  This preceded the newly established Sparrow Session, celebrating our mid-career researchers and made for an exciting first day of science delivered almost completely in person rather than by video link.  The Sparrow Session is named after Lyndsay Sparrow, who has attended every single Lorne Proteins Conference since inception, and he was pleasingly there to chair the first session!</p>
                                <p>This year the conference was joined by an embedded satellite meeting on computational biology, which covered a range of computational biology topics, a particular focus on the simulation of proteins and other biological systems. As well as talks, there were hands-on workshops on topics such as AlphaFold and molecular dynamics simulations, in silico mutational scanning as well as virtual screening. The augmented and virtual reality session was especially topical given the strong remote conference attendance.</p>
                                <p>Sadly, with international borders still closed at that time (they opened fully to visitors from the 21 February 2022) we were unable to welcome our international speakers in person.  However, 15 speakers gave talks with live Q & A through video link during the conference.  Highlights included Elizabeth Villa’s (University of California San Diego, USA) talk on cryo-electron tomography and Jeanne Stachowiak’s (University of Texas, USA) creative approach to uncovering how proteins sense membrane curvature.  Amy Yewdall (Radboud University, The Netherlands) took us into condensates in the nucleus, which Adrian Elcock (University of Iowa, USA) took us on his journey towards developing the capabilities of simulating an entire cell.  Hao Wu (Boston Children’s Hospital, USA) wowed with new inflammasome structures and Mimi Ho (Columbia University, USA) cautioned us not to throw out precious lysate from parasites because you might just find a protein structure by doing a little fractionation and putting it on it cryo-EM grid!</p>
                                <p>On that note, a series of European seminars were appropriately scheduled. A sufficiently late evening on this longitude is, after all, a reasonable time of day for our European colleagues. Featured in this session was Professor Robert Tampè from Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany, who gave the EMBO Keynote Lecture. </p>
                                <p>All in all, another wonderful entry in a long tradition of Lorne conferencing and certainly worthy of Syd’s legacy!</p>
