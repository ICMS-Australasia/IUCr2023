                                        <p>The timing of the IUCr Congress in Melbourne is at the tail end of our southern hemisphere winter cycle and the emerging spring brings an abundance of colour and vitality. A truly magical time of year when Melbourne flourishes.  Indeed, Australia’s floral emblem, the Golden Wattle, flowers at this time. Within easy walking distance of the Congress venue and the accommodation are The Queen Victoria Gardens, Fitzroy Gardens and Royal Botanic Gardens. All easily accessible choices to see nature’s beauty.</p>
                                        <p>The <a href = "https://iucr2023.org/call-for-abstracts/" target = "_blank">Call for Abstracts</a> is currently open until 21 November 2022, with early bird registration available up to 23 February 2023.  It is the strong desire of the organising committee to create an inclusive culture and diverse environment at IUCr 2023, which we believe starts with the formation of the academic program. We encourage you all to submit an abstract, share your knowledge and collaborate with the global crystallography community.</p>
                                        <p>Speaking on the topic of sharing research, the Congress team have been busily investigating a range of accommodation choices, from the best hotel facilities to backpackers, with guaranteed room blocks for our IUCr delegates, including students and families.</p>
                                        <p>If you have never been to Australia, it is worthwhile knowing that we have no added taxation at the point of sale.  The advertised price is the final price you will pay.  We also don’t have bed tax here! You can book directly via the website at any time. Alternatively, reach out to our accommodation team if you have an enquiry. </p>
                                        <p>Australia’s tax-free shopping is called the <a href = "https://www.abf.gov.au/entering-and-leaving-australia/tourist-refund-scheme" target = "_blank">Tourist Refund Scheme</a> (TRS), which allows overseas visitors and Australian residents to claim a refund of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), so save your receipts and claim at the airport upon departure.</p>
                                        <p>I am delighted to announce that since our last communication, Rigaku has been confirmed as a Diamond Sponsor for the Melbourne Congress in 2023; joining Bruker and Eldico.</p>
                                        <p>The local organising committee are looking forward to our next international trip at the end of October, when some of the Melbourne team, and a few furry friends, take off for Jeju for the 17th International Conference of the Asian Crystallographic Association. Be sure to stop by and see the team.</p>
                                        <p>Kind regards,</p>

                            <p>Melbourne has a superb range of accommodation to suit all budgets, tastes and delegates’ needs. Most of Melbourne’s city hotels are within walking distance of the Congress venue the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre, meaning delegates can navigate their way to and from the venue. Suppose walking is not you’re your preferred mode of transport. In that case, tram travel in the city of Melbourne is free, where most hotels, restaurants, bars and entertainment are located. Delegates can quickly get to the Congress venue and move easily around the city.</p>
                            <p>The IUCr 2023 team have secured a range of accommodation from shared apartments ideal for students on a budget to single premier rooms, all near the venue and first-class facilities for your consideration.</p>

                           <p>The start of ECM 33 was directly aligned with the launch of the IUCr 2023 Call for abstracts announcement.</p>
                           <p>Our team met over 350 attendees from across Europe and for one of them, the meeting proved extra worthwhile. Congratulations goes to Jake Weatherston from Newcastle University UK, the winner of the complimentary registration to IUCr 2023</p>

                            <h4>What do Penguins & Pastries & Crystallography have in Common?</h4>
                            <p>By Dr Daniel Eriksson</p>
                            <p>I always thought of penguins as aloof, majestic creatures. Serious looking and a little intimidating in their stark environment. They feel quite tall though it is hard to tell; the good nature documentaries tend not to show them alongside anything with a familiar scale. Theirs is a harsh, unforgiving land at the very bottom-end of the Earth and they endure their lot stoically. </p>
                            <p>So why then are these penguins about three apples tall, unbearably cute and on a beach? </p>
                            <p>This is because we are in St Kilda, Melbourne and these are Little Penguins. The Little Penguin is the only species of penguin that breeds in Australia. It is evening, and we're on the pier leading out to the breakwater. Among the rocks and sand, the little creatures, also known as Fairy Penguins, are making their way to and from the waterline. They are quite used to people; this is, after all, a major attraction for locals and tourists alike. </p>
                            <p>An inner seaside suburb of Melbourne, the Traditional Owners of St Kilda are the Yaluk-ut Weelam clan of the Boon Wurrung people of the Kulin Nation. Your best access is via tram (the light rail system supporting inner Melbourne) as St Kilda is located some 6 kilometres from the conference centre. Though it would be worth a visit for the waterfront and pier alone, the area has much else on offer. Luna Park, with its iconic' walk through the mouth of a giant clown' entrance, is an amusement park in operation since 1912. For food and drink, Acland Street is stroll-friendly and lined with restaurants and famous cake shops. The cuisine is international and the cakes have a distinct European heritage. The coffee, though, is all Melbournian. </p>
                            <p>If the local colony of 1,400 adults just isn't enough penguins and you yearn for more, then fear not. Philip Island is home to an additional 30,000 Fairy Penguins if you are willing to travel a bit farther. Located about 90 minutes' drive from Melbourne, the star attraction is the 'Penguin Parade’ This nature park offers a wide variety of activities, including self-guided or park ranger-led tours. One can remain at the visitor centre, where an underground viewing area allows the penguins to waddle right up to the window or head out on nightly tours of the beach to experience the birds in their element. Tickets can be purchased on-site at the visitor centre or booked ahead of time online.</p>
                            <p>So come on down under and you too can have your view of penguins receive a much-needed update!</p>
                            <p>If you are now inspired to visit St Kilda and the Little Penguins – write to <a href = "mailto:marketing@iucr2023.org">marketing@iucr2023</a> and tell us in 25 words or less why you would like two free passes for an Ultimate Adventure Tour or a Family Wildlife Tour at Philip Island Nature Park.</p>
